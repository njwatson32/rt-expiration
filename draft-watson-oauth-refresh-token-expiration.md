--- abstract

This specification extends OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] by adding new token endpoint
response parameters to specify refresh token expiration and user authorization
expiration.

# Introduction

RFC6749 defines the OAuth 2.0 protocol, part of which is the ability for a
client to receive a refresh token that may be repeatedly exchanged for more
access tokens. OAuth 2.0 does not contain any normative language around
expiration or lack thereof for refresh tokens, mentioning only that they are
"typically long-lasting".

In the years since the publication of OAuth 2.0, in response to changing
security and privacy landscapes, many authorization servers have begun to issue
shorter-lived refresh tokens for two main reasons:

*   The authorization server or user may decide that the access being granted is
    too sensitive to allow indefinite access (e.g. mail or health data).
*   The authorization server enforces a maximum duration that refresh tokens may
    be held without being exchanged on the token endpoint.

Clients may wish to implement special handling for expiring refresh tokens. For
example, if the user has granted expiring access, the client may notify the user
that they will need to reauthorize access before a certain date to avoid
interruption of service.

# Requirements Notation and Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Terminology

"Resource owner" and "user" may be used interchangeably to refer to the entity
capable of granting access to a protected resource.

"Client", "application", and "relying party" may be used interchangeably to
refer to the application making protected resource requests on behalf of the
resource owner and with its authorization.

# Concepts

There are two mechanisms that can affect refresh token expiration.

## Authorization expiration

When granting authorization for an application to access their data as
referenced in [RFC6749] Sec 4.1.1, the user may opt to time-limit that
authorization, especially if the data is sensitive or they aren't sure how long
they'll continue using the application. The authorization server itself may also
impose mandatory limits on authorization duration.

## Refresh token timeout

Authorization servers may wish to define a maximum amount of time clients can
hold a refresh token without exchanging it. Beyond the security benefit provided
by expiring credentials, this also provides a convenient mechanism for
authorization servers to change refresh token keys without having to accept old
credentials forever.

# Refresh token expiration

The refresh token MUST NOT expire later than the user authorization expires. It
MAY expire earlier if the authorization server also enforces a maximum duration
between refresh token exchanges.

If the user renews their authorization, the authorization server SHOULD update
the expiration time of existing refresh tokens if their lifetime was truncated
due to user authorization expiration. The authorization server MUST NOT accept
expired refresh tokens for any purpose, even if it has no way to update the
expiration time of existing refresh tokens.

Access tokens MUST NOT expire later than the user authorization expires. If the
user renews their authorization, the authorization server MAY update the
expiration time of existing access tokens if possible. Resource servers MUST NOT
accept expired access tokens for any purpose, even if the authorization server
has no way to update the expiration time of existing access tokens.

# Token endpoint response

This specification introduces two new response parameters.

## Successful response

    refresh_token_expires_in
          The lifetime in seconds of the refresh token. For example, the value
          604800 denotes that the refresh token will expire in one week from the
          time the response was generated. This value SHALL NOT exceed the value
          in authorization_expires_in.

    authorization_expires_in
          The lifetime in seconds of the user's authorization. For example, the
          value 2629800 denotes that the authorization will expire in one month
          from the time the response was generated. This value MAY exceed that
          of refresh_token_expires_in.

If finite, the authorization server MUST return these values whenever the token
endpoint response contains the `refresh_token` field. The authorization server
MAY return these values even if the response contains no `refresh_token` field
in the response, which can be useful in the following example cases:

*   For `refresh_token_expires_in`, the authorization server could have updated
    the existing refresh token lifetime in place.
*   For `authorization_expires_in`, the user's authorization lifetime could have
    been modified out of band.
*   In either case, it can be convenient for the client to receive these values
    in all responses.

### Infinite Expiration

Omitted values indicate that there is no fixed upper bound on the lifetime of
the credential or authorization. If the authorization server has not declared
its support for refresh token lifetime in the Authorization Server Metadata,
omitted response fields could indicate either indefinite validity or simply lack
of support for this specification. However, infinite expiration and lack of
information about expiration should be handled by the client in the same way.
That is to say, the client must always handle refresh token invalidation not
caused by expiration, such as by explicit user revocation.

Rather than omitting a response value, an authorization server may choose to
return a large arbitrary value, e.g. 315569520 for 10 years. This avoids any
ambiguity around support for infinite values while achieving a similar practical
effect. Clients MUST treat all large values as literals and MUST NOT make any
assumptions about which may be considered infinite.

## Error response

The existing `invalid_grant` error code already explicitly covers token
expiration and should be sufficient. Upon receiving this error code the client
SHOULD start a new authorization grant flow.

## Example

Suppose an authorization server enforces that refresh tokens must be exchanged
at least once every 7 days, and a user has granted authorization to an
application for access for 30 days. The initial exchange will result in the
following response values:

    refresh_token_expires_in: 604800  // 7 days
    authorization_expires_in: 2592000  // 30 days

An exchange 7 days after initial authorization will result in the following
response values:

    refresh_token_expires_in: 604800  // 7 days
    authorization_expires_in: 1987200  // 23 days

An exchange 28 days after initial authorization will result in the following
response values:

    refresh_token_expires_in: 172800  // 2 days
    authorization_expires_in: 172800  // 2 days

# Update to Authorization Server Metadata

Support for the expiring refresh tokens SHOULD be declared in the
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414] with the following
metadata:

    refresh_token_expiration_types_supported
        OPTIONAL. JSON array of supported expiration types. The possible values
        are "authorization" and "credential".

If the authorization server omits expiration time response fields to indicate
indefinite validity, it MUST declare `refresh_token_expiration_types_supported`
in its metadata to indicate to the client that it's aware of this spec.

# User Experience Considerations

TODO

# Security Considerations

While it is possible to allow refresh token expiration to exceed that of user
authorization expiration if the authorization server checks both timestamps when
validating a refresh token, this is a potentially dangerous source of bugs in
systems with complicated user authorization models. By requiring refresh tokens
to expire no later than user authorization expires, there is less risk of bugs
that accidentally provide data access to the client beyond the term of the
user's authorization.

TODO: Discuss relation to token rotation [OAuth 2.1 Sec 4.3.1]

# Privacy Considerations

Allowing users to time-limit their authorization is a privacy improvement. While
this was already doable in regular OAuth implementations, the potential
interruption of service for the user may have discouraged implementation of the
feature. This specification provides a standardized way to mitigate that concern
and should lead to greater adoption of time-limited authorization.

# IANA Considerations
